# special-quasidisorder-structure-code-SQDS

This respository saves the Python scripts about the Special Quasirandom Structure (SQS) and Special Quasidisorder Structure (SQDS) methods.

SQS denotes that the structure is fully random in atom arrangement. Each atomic correlation function aligns with the $(2x-1)^k$, where $x$ is the alloy composition and $k$ is the atom number in the cluster.

SQDS is the structure that has a partial disorder atom arrangement, not the fully random.
